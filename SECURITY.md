   - Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any potential impact. Screenshots or logs are also helpful if applicable.
   - Please avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

2. **Response and Resolution**:
   - Reports will be acknowledged promptly, and we aim to investigate all submissions within **5 business days**.
   - Upon validation, we will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Coordinated disclosure with the reporter will be arranged if public communication is needed.

## Our Approach to Security and Privacy

SecureChat is designed for anonymous, encrypted communication. Here are the core principles and features that make SecureChat unique:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are secured using AES-256 encryption, ensuring that only participants in the conversation can access their contents.
- **Anonymity by Design**: SecureChat requires no personal identifiers or user accounts, protecting user identity from the outset.
- **Unique Room Codes**: Rooms are accessible only through unique, randomly generated codes, allowing users to create private chat rooms securely.
- **No Data Storage**: SecureChat does not store user messages or metadata. Each session is private, and no chat history is retained.

We prioritize privacy and work to ensure that SecureChat remains a tool for confidential, secure, and anonymous conversations.

Users are encouraged to use SecureChat within the terms outlined in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for personal and non-commercial purposes only.
